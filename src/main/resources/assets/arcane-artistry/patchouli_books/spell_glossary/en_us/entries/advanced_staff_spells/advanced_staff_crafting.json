Now add more $(bold)lapis lazuli$() in form of blocks and rare $(bold)lapis crystals$() to enhance the magical capabilities of the staff. Moreover, strengthen the handle using $(bold)obsidian$() as well as a $(bold)blaze rod$() to ensure your staff will not break. Place the items in the crafting grid as seen on the other page."
